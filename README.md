# rrplot

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The purpose of `rrplot` is to provide auditors of the Norwegian Office
of the Auditor General with the ability to make beautiful and
in-accordance graphs with `ggplot2`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rrplot from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("joasand-rr/rrplot")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(rrplot)
## basic example code
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
